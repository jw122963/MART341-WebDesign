                as is or modified to suit whatever your situation might be.</p>
            <p>Our diverse tool range allows us to work in any scale from 1:220 all the way up to 1:3rd live steam!  All of our products come with a 3 year warranty, and with our
                one-off models and prototypes we are able to offer a full refund within the first year for any mechanical or electrical defect on our part.</p>
