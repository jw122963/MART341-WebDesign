            <p> The future is now!  Miniatures being produced today for anything from the trainset to the wargaming table are increasingly using modern technologies to cut costs
                and improve production.  When it comes to our business, we use the latest and greatest to get the best results.  At our in-house shop and production facility,
                Model Train Maker has several technologies in our toolbox:</p>
                
                 <ul>
                       <li>3D printing</li>
                       <li>Laser cutting</li>
                       <li>CNC machining</li>
                       <li>Injection molding</li>
                 </ul> 
            
             <p>In addition to these new technologies we also have at our disposal an entire suite of new software ranging from Solidworks and Fusion360 to advanced 3D scanning
                 that can easily replicate almost anything. As trained machinists, CAD drafters, and enthusiastic supporters of the hobby, there is very little our small team
                 can't do.  If you would like to learn more please feel free to reach out. If you are interested to know what sorts of services we off be sure to check out our
                 services page.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you and see you down the line!</p>
