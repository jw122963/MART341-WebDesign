Question 1:  While I have done coding before, I have never done anything with html or css prior to this course.  Honestly, it was eye-opening to see just how much can be done
when working on a website manually.  I do have a website and made a couple of blogs a decade ago in high school but I relied on programs to do all the heavy lifting for me.
Basically, this was a completely new experience and every assignment I learned something new about the basics of web development.

Question 2: I have a bit of background in art, and as I said there was some experimenting with blogs way back in highschool, so the actual web design part wasn't quite as new
and unknown as the development side of things.  That being said, I did learn plenty about manually adjusting how a website looks and feels.

Question 3: My biggest challenge this semester by far was finding the time to sit down and actually learn about this class.  As a Geoscience major, this particular course is way outside
what has been a typical college course for me.  On top of that, I've spent the first half of the semester living out of my truck and the second half of the semester working 30hrs per
week in order to pay for the apartment I only moved into in mid-October.  In some ways, I guess I didn't really overcome that problem because here I am typing this two hours past the
deadline.  Truthfully, without such an understanding instructor I would have probably dropped this course to save my sanity and focus more on the courses directly related to my major.
But since I'm still in the game here, I was able to get every single assignment and test done for all my classes, including this one even if some of those assignments are late.
