Question 1: System fonts are those that are installed by default on a computer by the manufacturer or company that made the OS default systems.
            Web-fonts are those found across the internet but they are not installed on every computer.
            Web-safe fonts are default font styles which can be found almost universally on devices and software.  Therefore these fonts are safe to use on a website
            with little risk of being unreadable to certain people.
Question 2: Fall-back fonts are needed in case a device that is viewing your website does not have the primary font installed for a particular part of the website.
            These fall-back fonts are there for insurance, so that if the computer can't read the first style, it can 'fall back' onto second, third, and fourth font styles.
            However, if a computer needs to get to it's fourth font style I'd be concerned about who made that computer and why it's so cheap.
Question 3: The biggest hurdle I had with this assignment was wrapping my head around the relationship between html and css but I think I'm finally starting to understand it.
