Question 1:  My experience with html has only begun but I finally feel like I was able to complete this assignment without too much difficulty.  Taking the extra time these last few weeks to really learn html and follow your formatting has helped me in many ways.  Html at it's heart feels like a lot of other coding languages, but like any language it has it's 
difficult parts.  For me, the most difficult was grasping the more complex formatting options like tables.
Question 2: Now that I've had a lot of time to learn outside of class about css I'm not nearly as intimidated as I was a month ago.
Question 3:  My challenge this month has been learning to work with html and css without direct supervision or guidance.  I think I have finally succeeded in the final hours of the class!
