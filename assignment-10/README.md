Question 1:
Universal selectors will style elements on every page of a website, while an element selector will only style elements of a particular type.
Class Elements will style elements that serve the same function and ID selectors will style an element with one particular name or ID.

Question 2:
The art deco period of American history (1918-1929) was the definitive architectural and design style of the roaring 20's.
Colors of the period were typical metallic or vibrant primary/secondary colors.  To best represent the feel of this period, I went with
Dark Cyan representing a primary color, Silver which represents the steel, concrete and glass from the period, and Dark Golden Rod for its
similarity to fresh copper.

Question 3:
My challenge this week was catching up after falling behind on work due to conflicting priorities.  In order to catch up I spent the week reading 
what I had missed and finally put all of that to use on this week's assignment.
