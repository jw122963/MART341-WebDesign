      The Art Deco era in American history is marked by a unique architectural and design style that has yet to experience an official 'revival'.
      Deco as a consistent design style first appeared in France prior to World War I.  After helping to win the Great War, Americans brought the
      Style across the Atlantic where it spread like wildfire across the Northeast and Midwest.  Through the 1920s, major American Cities such as
      Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York experienced an explosion of Art Deco styling.

      Famous existing buildings from the period that show art deco styling include the Empire State Building, the Como Park Zoo and St. Paul City 
      Hall in Minnesota, Century Tower in Chicago, and the Cincinnatti Union Terminal in Ohio.  These 'modern' buildings used concrete,
      large glass windows, and utilized symmetry to create buildings unique to America.  Many of these buildings are now national landmarks.

      Unlike other art and architectural styles, Art Deco has not yet experienced a major revival in popularity.  It did have a small resurgance
      in the 1960s but was quickly supplanted with other iconic styles just like American rock was sidelined during the British Invasion.  Art Deco
      was supposedly resurging in 2020, but like everything else COVID has delayed and possibly prevented that resurgence from happening. It may be for
      the best though because the 2020s are not shapping up to being like the 1920s at all!
