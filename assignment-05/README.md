Question 1:

I went to Youtube's site circa 2005 near when the video browser site first launched.  What strikes me about the site is not how much it has changed, but rather how much it has
basically remained the same.  Sure, Youtube has gone the route of simpler logos with the play button instead of the name and of course the menus look a lot older, but they
are far from being completely outdated.  The visual interface has changed though, with a lot cleaner, rounded edges and a more extensive menu and sidebar.  Probably the biggest
change has been the advertising.  While on the old site ads were sparse and limited to certain areas, modern Youtube is completely inundated with ads on every video and in every
corner of the site.

Question 2:

I learned a lot about basic web formatting in the past couple of weeks.  By far the biggest challenge has been getting the links to work properly.
