Question 1: A border is a line or some sort of separation between an element and its surroundings.  Padding is the distance between the element and its border.
Margin is the distance between a border and the edge of the page and/or other borders.

Question 2: My challenge for this particular assignment was finding a way to organize the page so that I could go back and understand how each control was effecting elements.  Rather than group everything together I decided instead to separate all the elements so that I could manipulate each with one or two controls rather than all of them at once.
